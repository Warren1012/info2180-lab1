 <p>Hailing from the garden parish of St.Ann, Jamaica, is your not-so-average "country boy". Technology has always interested rather than the stereotypical expectations of a country boy. I am Jamaica College old boy hoping to achieve big things. Web development is a skill that will be of great benefit to me as pursue a career in programming. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Management Studies. </p>
